All contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements, and ideas are welcome.
This is part of a learning journey, I hope to make my own games so if you feel like there´s an idea you wish to see come true
create a request with your ideas and hopefully if i can make them i´ll try and send you my work.
